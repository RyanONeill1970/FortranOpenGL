To use this package you need a Fortran 2003 compiler. 

Unpack the files:
  tar xzvf f03gl.tgz
or
  unzip f03gl.zip
The files will be extracted into a new f03gl directory. Change to this
directory. Check that the Makefile is set up to use the correct
compiler and the appropriate libraries. Also set the GLUT variable for
the version of GLUT that you intend to use. Then just run make. This
should compile the OpenGL_gl, OpenGL_glu and OpenGL_glut object and
module files, and then compile and run the test files, one after the
other. You will need to quit from each test before the next one will
run. The first three tests are rather boring, but in the last three
you can bring up a menu with a right mouse click and change some of
the properties of the display. From the f90 code you can see how to do
similar things in your own code. These examples are slightly-modified
versions of the examples provided with Bill Mitchell's f90gl package 
http://math.nist.gov/f90gl/They should run on 64-bit architectures as
well as 32-bit.
